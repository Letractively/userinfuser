==Debugging Tips==

Here are some tips for debugging with UserInfuser:

 * Turn debugging on when using a client library for development
 * Make all request synchronous to see error messages during development
 * Make sure when doing get_widget you are requesting the correct widget
   * trophy_case
   * milestones
   * leaderboard
   * rank
   * notifier

If its a custom deployment, look at the error logs at appspot.com

Common Mistakes:
 * Use the the badge id for API usage, not just the name
 * Badge ids look like: theme-name-private
 * Not giving the correct API key or account email address

Conerns
 * The rank widget does not update right away as points are awarded. It is cached and only recalculated after 10 minutes have passed.
