= Introduction =

This wiki page describes how to run your own gamification platform using !UserInfuser on Google App Engine and !AppScale. If you don't want to go through the hassle of propping it up visit http://cloudcaptive.com to use this platform as a paid service. 

= Download The Application =

Download the application from [http://userinfuser.googlecode.com/files/userinfuser-0.9.2.tar.gz here]. Do not use the SVN repository.

= Steps For Google App Engine =
  
  * Go to appspot.com
  * Sign up and select a unique application identifier
  * Enable billing (blobstore requires it)
  * Download the SDK
  * Change the name of the application name in the code in userinfuser/serverside/constants.py and userinfuser/app.yaml
  * There are some sender emails in signup.py that should be changed to the owner of the app's email (currently raj at cloudcaptive.com). Grep/search for the email in the code and change it to your own.
  * Upload your application to google's infrastructure
     * python appcfg.py update userinfuser
  * Change the client side api name to your app identifier

= Steps for !AppScale =
This option is for those who want to host it on their own hardware (Xen, KVM, physical hardware, Eucalyptus) or on a public cloud like Amazon's EC2.
  * Setup and run !AppScale: http://code.google.com/p/appscale
    * Version 1.5 or greater
  * The code must be modified to find and replace where you see appspot.com to the machine you are running it on (ip:port)
  * Deploy the application
     * appscale-upload-app --file userinfuser
     * or use the upload webpage
  * Change the client side api url to where !AppScale is hosting it

= Steps for Dev Server =
To run the development server do the following:
  * Modify constants.py by adding your email to the test accounts (TEST_ACCOUNTS)
  * Download and unpackage the google SDK.
  * Go into the top level directory
  * Run: "python2.5 dev_appserver.py <path-to-userinfuse>
  * Point your browser to http://localhost:8080
  * Sign up twice with your test account (it will tell you your test account as been activated)
